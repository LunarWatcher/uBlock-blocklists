!! This blocklist contains various sites with AI-generated  content (provided entire articles are AI-generated),
!! and individual elements with AI-generated content. This list is primarily focused on various sources of AI-generated
!! information, including news sources, blogs, etc.
!! This is primarily as an attempt to reduce exposure to genAI misinformation, which there unfortunately is
!! enormous quantities of now. 
!!
!! This list also goes into the details on certain sites that are otherwise mostly human-generated. This does not
!! blanket-block any site with some AI-generated content, but focuses on sites that are primarily AI-generated,
!! as well as AI-generated elements on the rest (such as summaries).
!! 
!! See also https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist for more AI blocking 
!! Note that unlike that list, this list does not block the results from search, as I don't feel like implementing it.
!! That list also takes a much more hardline stance on when to block sites, and focuses far more on general AI tools. YMMV
!!
!! This list will grow as I find bad sites.
!! Also note that this list is written with vim fold marks, to make it slightly more readable in at least the editor I use
