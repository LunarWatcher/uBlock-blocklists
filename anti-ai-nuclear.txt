!! This extension of the anti-ai blocklist deals with certain offending sites _far_ more aggressively
!! than the original list
!! While the original list primarily goes after individuals and organisations, this list targets
!! sites that facilitate this kind of crap at a scale.
!!
!! This list is intentionally aggressive. Sites that appear regularly as a platform to spread
!! entries that make it into the anti-ai.txt list make it into this list. This includes several
!! very commonly used sites, including Medium and the cancer that is LinkedIn
!! Note that this only applies if the platform:
!!
!! 1. Doesn't care about, or actively encourages genAI content, and
!! 2. Doesn't enforce the explicit labelling of such content, and
!! 3. Isn't dedicated to genAI content, or doesn't use it as an SEO hijacking strategy
!!
!! For example, dev.to, while having a fuckton of generated articles, fails the second point of this test, and
!! is therefore not on this list.
!! AI-oriented sites and sites that spew out genAI blog articles as an SEO heist (i.e. fail point 3)
!! go in the main list instead; they're blockable, but they're not nuclear.
!!
!! Note: this list complements the anti-ai list. If you're using this, you probably also want the
!! non-nuclear list (but not necessarily vice versa)
