# uBlock-blocklists

Contains my own blocklist and whitelist queries.

Quick install links:
* Main list: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LunarWatcher/uBlock-blocklists/master/Blocklist.txt`
* Anti-AI misinformation list: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LunarWatcher/uBlock-blocklists/master/anti-ai.txt`
* Nuclear anti-AI misinformation list: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LunarWatcher/uBlock-blocklists/master/anti-ai-nuclear.txt`
    * **WARNING:** This list is intentionally _extremely_ aggressive, and includes major sites that just don't care about genAI content, including medium.com and LinkedIn. If this isn't a price you're willing to pay, stick with the standard anti-AI misinformation list, which doesn't target nearly as broadly. Also note that you'll need to install the standard anti-AI list in addition to the nuclear list, as the nuclear list does not contain everything the normal list does.
